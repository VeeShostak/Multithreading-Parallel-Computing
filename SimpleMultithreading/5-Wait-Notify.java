// Wait and notify 

// wait() called only within synchronized block. It hands over the control over the block that the synchronized block is locked on.

// notify() notifies the waiting thread that it can wake up. 
// Has to be Nondeterministic (if multiple threads are waiting for the lock (locking on the class) there is no guarantee what thread will get the lock eventually (if we call notify, not sure if 2nd thread or 3rd threadâ€¦ is going to wake up )).

// Call notify(), and if we have some code after notify, it will run first, then will notify the waiting thread that it can wake up. 

// wait(1000); // can specify how long it will wait

//  NotifyAll() notifies all threads, for many threads

// Output:
// We are in the producer method...
// Consumer method...
// Again in producer method...
